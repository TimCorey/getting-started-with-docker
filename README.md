# Getting Started with Docker
Code from my Getting Started with Docker session.

## Instructions
To follow along, open up each folder in succession, starting from Getting Started and going through each of the samples. Each folder has a Readme file that will walk you through the demo. You will need the .NET Core 3.0 SDK installed on your computer, but you do not need Visual Studio to get these projects to launch. You do need Docker Desktop installed (from https://hubs.docker.com).
